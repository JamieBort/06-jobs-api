~~Disregard this. this pertains to NEXT weeks lesson.~~

Heads Up

This lesson has an optional component with Swagger. For that, the video has you navigate to APIMatic.io to convert the exported Postman Collection json file to a format that can be imported into Swagger.

I attempted to sign up for their free tier with my gmail account and received an error indicating that I needed to use a `valid business email address`.

I am looking for alternatives to this website. If/when I find one, I'll follow up here to share it.
Likewise, if anyone has an alternative, please share it with the rest of us.

Thank you!

EDIT: later I have received a `Unable to complete sign-up. please try again.` response to the sign-up form.
