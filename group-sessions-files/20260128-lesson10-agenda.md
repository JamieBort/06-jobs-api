#### TO-DO items for this session

My personal checklist (to make sure I don't forget anything).

- Before meeting
  - [x] Paste url to this file in the agenda above.
  - [x] Post to the announcements Slack channel regarding
    - the presence of the notes I have drafted (The section on the dependencies is strictly for your edification - that is to say, it is more information about them and not required to complete the assignment.),
    - my intention to walk through the process of deploying the Node Express app to Render. We may not have enough time to finish. And/or we may run into unforeseen issues. But this will be a learning experience either way.
    - the optional component with Swagger issue of using APIMatic. And
    - FWIW, it will be recorded.

- Beginning of meeting
  - [x] Enable live closed captions.
  - [x] Enable transcriptions. (this MIGHT not be necessary)
  - [x] Put the agenda link in the group chat:
  - [x] Walk through the code. What was written and why?

- End of meeting
  - [x] Save transcriptions.
  - [x] Stop recording.
